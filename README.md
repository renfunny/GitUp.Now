# GitUp.Now
Application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The data is being fetched by a third party API "ExerciseDB" (https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/). Part of the CSS is handled by Bootstrap.

## Guide
The program allows user to enter their name, Email address, and workouts they wish to see listed in the exercises page. The user's information and mucle group choice(s) will then be saved to local storage so that when the exercise's page loads, it can fetch data based on the stored values right away. Upon hitting submit, the user is redirected to the exercises page where they get a populated page full of example exercises based on their selection(s). These cards include a GIF of a demonstration on how to do the exercise, the name of the exercise, the body part it hits, and the equipment required.

## Demo
